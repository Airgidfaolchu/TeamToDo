## Team Todo Node.js App

This is an example of a shared ToDo list.

It creats three MongoDB collections:

1. Projects
2. Tasks
3. Users

It uses Passport.js for local and social authentication (currently: Facebook, Twitter, Google+).

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory, and run **npm install** in the Command-line interface / Terminal
2. Change MONGODB_URI in app.js to your db's URI.
3. Start MongoDB by typing mongod.
4. In a separate Command-line interface / Terminal type **node app.js**
